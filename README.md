**For Forkers**  
1. I recently just removed all binaries and put the assets folder (containing .png, .mp3) from the repo and put them in the [Dowloads page](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/kungfunekko/downloads)!!! I did this since they shouldn't have been tracked in the first place (read my P.S. below) but rather should have been placed in the [Dowloads page](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/kungfunekko/downloads).  
2. All you need to have to continue this project is the source code in the src folders and the assets in the [Dowloads page](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/kungfunekko/downloads). You can figure it out! If you can't the e-mail me at vestrel00@gmail.com and I will post instructions in the [Dowloads page](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/kungfunekko/downloads) on how to set things up in eclipse.  

**P.S.**  
1. I completely forgot to add a .gitignore from beginning to end!!!!  
This means that binaries (.class files and the like) have been repeatedly commited =(.  
Also image and sound files (.xcf, .png, .mp3) have also been tracked by this repo  
from beginning to end. I know I should not have tracked binaries and put   
image and sound files on the downloads page of this wiki but I was being stupid   
(I'm sorry T_T). Imagine saving the diffs in binaries... ewww.  
So that is why the size of the repo is 90mb when it should only be no more than 1mb (just code).   
Apologies guys, I must look like a real newb monkey to you all XD  
2. However, I recently just removed all binaries and put the assets folder (containing .png, .mp3) from the repo and put them in the [Dowloads page](https://bitbucket.org/vestrel00/kungfunekko/downloads)!!!  
3. I know that the code is messy and that a lot of things can be re-written to make things   
cleaner and faster but I rushed things to make the 10 day self-challenge.
