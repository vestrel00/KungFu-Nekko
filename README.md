**P.S.**  
1. I completely forgot to add a .gitignore from beginning to end!!!!  
This means that binaries (.class files and the like) have been repeatedly commited =(.  
Also image and sound files (.xcf, .png, .mp3) have also been tracked by this repo  
from beginning to end. I know I should not have tracked binaries and put   
image and sound files on the downloads page of this wiki but I was being stupid   
(I'm sorry T_T). Imagine saving the diffs in binaries... ewww.  
So that is why the size of the repo is 90mb when it should only be no more than 5 mb.   
So if you fork this make sure that you replace the libgdx library in the repo with the  
newest version available at [http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/).  
Apologies guys, I must look like a real newb monkey to you all XD
