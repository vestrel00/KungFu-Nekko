** If you browse the source code you will see the apache license at the beginning of
each one. I know that the code is basically not reusable since I hard coded everything in
when I could have used JSON, XML, or text file to store values so they can be easily modified.
However, I just put the license there for consistency 
and because it make the code look graceful even though it is chicken scratch XD.
It is pretty trivial to put stuff on a text file or JSON or whatever then parse the data
at run time in order to keep the source code short and sweet (and reusable) but it is also
boring and slows me down a bit in setting things up.

*** I admit the code is not really good and is unreusable. However, I still licensed it
under the Apache License 2.0 since I take pride in any of my works - trivial or not.
